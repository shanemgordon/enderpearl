# enderpearl
 A port of the Ender pearl item from Minecraft (Java) to Garry's Mod (Source engine/Lua)

This was a small project I endeavored to make earlier in my computer science career. I realized that in future when applying for internships or a job in this field that I would need to learn to adapt to and learn the conventions of a larger organization's codebase. Following that logic, I made a quick 'addon' for the game Garry's Mod which takes the Enderpearl item from the popular game Minecraft and recreates it in Garry's Mod with the same functionality.

The scripting for this modification was written in Lua, a javascript-like scripting language which allows custom behavior to be built upon an existing codebase to be compatible with the base game and other modifications.
